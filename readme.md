# Intruder Detection System

![Logo](static\favicon.png) 

An intruder detection system will be implemented using Flask as a platform to create a Python endpoint, YOLO object detection, and MongoDB logging to store the detected intrusions. The system will work by capturing video from the camera, specifying objects to be detected, and logging into MongoDB and sounding the alarm.

## Features

- Real-time video stream from a camera.
- Object detection for specific classes.
- Logging of detection events to MongoDB.
- Sound alert when an object is detected.
- Web interface to display the video feed.
